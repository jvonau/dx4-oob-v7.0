This module allows customization of the OLPC boot animation.
There are two modes of customization available.

Firstly, you can add your own PNG image to the boot animation display. It
will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, center-aligned. Simply specify
the path to the file in the following manner:

[bootanim]
custom_image=/path/to/custom/image



Alternatively, if you wish to perform deeper customizations, you can include
your own plymouth theme and use it instead of the OLPC default. Plymouth is the
platform which the boot animation is built upon. It allows creation of boot
themes through a simple scripting language.
See the Plymouth theming guide (http://brej.org/blog/?p=158) for how to get
started.

If going down this route, you will first need to get your theme included
in the build image. You could package it in RPM format and use the
custom_packages module to include it.

Then, simply specify the name of the theme in the configuration of this
module:

[bootanim]
theme=mytheme
