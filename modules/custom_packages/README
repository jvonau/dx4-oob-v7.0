This module allows you to specify a comma-separated list of packages to add
or remove from the build, from the repositories already configured (usually
through the repos module).

Options must be named "add_packages" or "del_packages", or you may also
use option names prefixed with "add_packages_" and "del_packages_".


Example:

[custom_packages]
add_packages=tomboy,gnucash
add_packages_extras=pidgin
del_packages=totem
