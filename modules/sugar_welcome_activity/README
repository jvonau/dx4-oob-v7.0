This module is EXPERIMENTAL and usage may change.

This module allows you auto-start an activity or other program in the
first Sugar startup -- before the user enters a name and picks icon colors.

By default it will use the Welcome activity -- you MUST have it installed
for this to work.

It can also

 - Customize the images displayed by the welcome activity.

 - Start a _different_ activity or program.

Take care - this module will also let you break the Welcome activity.

Basic configuration -- just put an empty section(ensure you
are including the Welcome activity!):

  [sugar_welcome_activity]
  # nothing here, magic defaults

Advanced configurations:

  Changing welcome images

   [sugar_welcome_activity]
   images_path=/home/myuser/welcome-images

  Using a different activity

   [sugar_welcome_activity]
   welcome_screen_cmd=python /home/olpc/Activities/MyCustomWelcome.activity/activity.py

  Using a different program

   [sugar_welcome_activity]
   welcome_screen_cmd=/usr/bin/someprogram --option parameter
