This module allows you to configure an OATS server used by olpc-update,
overriding the default of antitheft.laptop.org

Options:

server: the address of an OATS server to use

ignore_xs: by default, the OATS client always contacts the school server
before trying other servers (maybe not even trying them at all). set this to 1
to override this behaviour, the school server will not be tried. Useful in
deployments with good connectivity where antitheft is controlled in a central
location (as opposed to the specific school).

ignore_signature: by default, the OATS client will expect the server's response to be signed, and it will verify the signature. Set this to 1 to ignore all
signatures (and also accept messages with no signature). Useful for
deployments that have not implemented OLPC's security system, but still wish
to take advantage of other OATS features.

stream: the update stream - this is helpful when deploying different OS images
that query the same update server.

Example configuration:
[oats_cfg]
server=my-oats-server.mydeployment.com
ignore_xs=1
ignore_signature=1
stream=xo15hs
