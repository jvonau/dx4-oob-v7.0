Include this module in your build if you want to enable the on-screen keyboard.

The keyboard language can be changed with a horizontal swipe on the
touchscreen. By default, this scrolls through a long list of languages.
If you wish to configure this list to just cycle through a few keyboard
of relevance to your deployment, use the 'languages' option, e.g.:

[osk]
languages=en_gb,de,es
